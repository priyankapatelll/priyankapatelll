## Hey, It's Pri!  💁🏾‍♀️

  I'm a recent bootcamp graduate from Tech Elevator who studied Java Web Application Development. Although I had a non-traditional start to my software development career, the pivot made has been a fruitful choice that re-ignited my former passions as a "tinkerer" at heart. Returning to my original passion, as a Software Developer, I'm excited to find where I can make a change today. 
  
  Check me out below, & I'm always open for a chat!
